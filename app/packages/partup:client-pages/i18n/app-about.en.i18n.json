Individuals, employees and freelancers can participate as uppers and join part-ups for free. With a premium account you can also create non-public part-ups for more private dreams or confidential projects. Communities and organizations can buy their own tribe on Part-up, to start and share part-ups with just the people they choose.",
    "pages-app-about-socialimpact-part2": "We believe teamwork gets much better if you have the freedom to choose your teammates and your activities. We develop our matching algorithm to help you find the best team members. Uppers receive notifications of new and matching part-ups. You can join these part-ups as a supporter to share your expertise or as a partner to actively contribute to the activities. The partners together decide on the activities and rate each others contributions.",
